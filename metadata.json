  "long_description": "The Hadamard test estimates the real part of the expectation value \u27e8\u03c8|U|\u03c8\u27e9 using one ancilla qubit. The ancilla is placed in superposition, a controlled-U is applied, and a final Hadamard on the ancilla transforms the relative phase into a probability difference. For U=Z and |\u03c8\u27e9=|+\u27e9, Re(\u27e8+|Z|+\u27e9) = 0, so both outcomes are equally likely. The imaginary part uses an S\u2020 gate.",
